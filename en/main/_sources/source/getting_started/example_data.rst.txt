Obtaining Example Data
======================

Several tutorials and the unit tests expect example data files to be available in
this repository. These files are provided as a separate archive on GitHub.

Download the data archives from the `0.0.0-example-data` release:
https://github.com/usnistgov/PyHyperScattering/releases/tag/0.0.0-example-data

After downloading, unzip the archives in the repository root so that directories
such as ``Example/`` are created. The continuous integration tests also fetch
these archives during setup, so your local tests will fail without them.
